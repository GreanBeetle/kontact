This mobile app is for demo purposes only and is meant to demonstrate knowledge of React Native, Redux, Redux Thunk, hooks, and Jest. The functionality itself is limited to two basic stories. (A) Display a list of 15 kontacts (i.e. people, contacts, friends). Each kontact in the list should have a first name, last name, and email address. (B) When the user presses a kontact list item, the kontact detail page should appear and display first name, last name, email address, address (street, apt or suite, city, zip code), phone number, website, and company name. Otherwise this app has been treated as if it were to be published on the App and Play stores.      

### running a build 

This project does not use Expo, so you will need to use the [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/) guide to get up and running.
